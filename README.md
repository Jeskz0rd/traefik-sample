# Traefik - HTTPS

A very very quick setup of [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik/) as a reverse proxy.

This setup also configures a simple [GO API](https://hub.docker.com/r/jeskz0rd/docker-bootcamp) that runs on port `8000` and is only available to be accessed through Traefik.

At the moment, this setup should be used for test purposes only.

I developed this solution to be used as a reverse proxy guide. There's a lot of work to be done here, so feel free to develop by your own, open a PR or an issue :)
